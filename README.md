### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Tharindu Wijayarathna, a Software Engineer from Sri Lanka ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡°. I am a Software Engineering Undergraduate at Cardiff Metropolitan University, UK. I am passionate about building software and learning new technologies. I am making new composer and npm packages as a hobby to help people to do their developing activities very fast. I can make robust, user friendly and well optimized web apps for clients.

I previously worked as a Software Engineer at [CyberElysium](https://cyberelysium.com/), a software product engineering company in Sri Lanka. I have experience in developing web applications using technologies such as PHP, Laravel, Vue.js, React.js, Node.js, and MySQL. I have also worked on projects that involve technologies such as Docker, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines.
